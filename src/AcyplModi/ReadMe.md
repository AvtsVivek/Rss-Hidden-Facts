20 years ago in 1994 Sri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, visited USA on the invitation of ACYPL (American Council of Young Political Leaders).
I was part of his team along with Sri Ananth Kumar Union Minister for fertilizers and Chemicals and today he is visiting USA again as the proud Prime Minister of India. 
Let us greet him to make this historic movement in Indo-US relation. 
Here are a few pictures from my memory-lane which I feel to share with you to reminisce the occasion.
