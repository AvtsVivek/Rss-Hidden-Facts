So 10 years ago we had Congress Mukt Bharat ringing in our ears.
Now what? Time for BJP Mukt Bharat?

Are you aware about Former CBI Director Nageswara Rao?
I mentioned him - They never make Hindus Buddhiman. They only make Hindus Moorkh, Remember?

So in his recent tweet he Explains 14 Reasons to Vote Out Modi Govt.

And here is the tweet. Take a look at it. It has 14 points.

https://twitter.com/MNageswarRaoIPS/status/1776285336932372769

And he elaborated that in an interview. 

For me none of those are new, I have heard from other sources before. This is just a validation for me.

But this presents a nice summary. Its 2 hour long video, I have broken that and sprinkled some notes. Its the same video referenced according to time. 

Do take out some time to listen in. Its worth it. Then let me know what you think.

First, some Highlights ....

There is no item on which there is no GST.

Vikasit or Vilapit Bharat

RSS BJP are the biggest Traitors.

BJP - Bhrastachari Janata Party.

BJP Washing Machine. Since 2014, 25 Opposition leaders facing corruption probe switched to BJP, 23 get reprieve. 

Ok, Here it goes....

Its a question of survival of Hindu Civilization which is under threat due to RSS and BJP.

Reason 1. ModiSarkar is undoubtedly the most corrupt govt.
BJP is undoubtedly the most corrupt party and government. All its talk of NA KHAUNGA NA KHANE DUNGA is humbug
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=91 

Most corrupt, not just BJP Govt, but also the BJP Party.

Bhrastachari Janata Party.
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=515


Amendments made in 2018 to Prevention of Corruption Act  are at variance with this emotional speech of Modi Ji.
Ability of CBI & all State Anti-Corruption Bureau is destroyed as they canNOT start even a preliminary enquiry against even a peon without prior order of Govt etc.

In here, the Retired Director says an important point.
Say someone accuses me of some corruption.
Then if I request CBI to do an enquiry on me, the CBI will not be able to do anything. Why? because it needs permission.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRQFB2vKgmU&t=648s


They have systematically destroyed the anti-corruption mechanism in the country.

Reason 2. ModiSarkar is the biggest Hindu Drohi in the entire world history. 
BJP is the most anti-Hindu party and the biggest the RSS-BJP are Hindu Drohis in the entire world history. Because having acquired political power entirely on Hindu votes, they not redressed any of the legitimate grievances and disabilities by not amending articles 25 to 30 of the Constitution for giving #EqualRightsForHindus on par with those given to Minority Christians and Muslims; by not enacting a central Temple Act and repealing allState Temple laws to #FreeTemples from secular governments' control, etc.

https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=1052

Articles 25 to 30
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=1150
grievance 
   1. Articles 25 to 30
   2. Hindus cannot run their own temples.
   3. Minority appeasement
   4. Educational institutions

They re not only ignored but actually perpetuated those against hindus. In Uttarakhand, the BJP govt has captured temples.
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=1240


Reason 3. ModiSarkar is the biggest Hindu Drohi in the entire world history. 

When Supreme Court liberated #shriramjanmbhoomi from partial encroachment by Muslims by ruling in favor of Hindus, the RSS-BJP-VHP usurped it from Hindu society, then in the name of construction of Temple collected from Hindus more than Rs 3,200 crores officially, and Bhagwan knows how many thousands of crores the RSS-BJP-VHP karyakartas and leaders collected in cash and misappropriated.

Ram Mandir. 3200 Crores officially. Again its captured by govt.

Real colors of RSS. Once it gets to power, it became Hindu Virodh, Hindu Drohi or traitor
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=1851


Reason 4. The BJP has been indulging in unprecedented #Minority_Appeasement by misusing public funds for promoting sectarian interests of Christians and Muslims. In the past 10 years about Rs. 50,000 Crores of secular public funds have been spent for welfare of Minorities based on their religious identity but not a single paisa for the welfare of Hindus on the basis of religious identity.

Naukri Jihad and Job Crusade
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=2488


Reason 5. In the past 10 years, the number of Hindus killed in decentralized and distributed low intensity Islamic Jihadi terrorist attacks on Hindus is probably the highest in comparison with any corresponding period.

https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=2812


Reason 6. The Modi Sarkar has destroyed the Indian Military through # agniveer scheme.

Why do I keep on saying BJP is a Jihadi party? Here it goes...

https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=2831


Indian Military is Emasculated.

ToD is coped from US which never won any war as ToDs don’t fight but only pass time to complete tenure.

USA concept “Tour of Duty” renamed as “Agneepath” is getting implemented.
All top policy makers and Military officers may kindly know that in its entire history the US Military did not win a single war.
https://twitter.com/MNageswarRaoIPS/status/1530414724868734976


Tour of Duty is US concept of taking temporary soldiers for 3-5 yrs as a result US Military never won any war.
Govt is copying it into our Army which will be disastrous.
Why is there no public debate on such vital issue?
Where are Media, TV channels, Retd Army Officers?

Reason 7. The ModiSarkar has let the Chinese to occupy huge tracts of Indian territory in the past 10 years
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=3315

In the last 10 years we have lost more than 2000 sq kms to China. There are so many reports.
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=3330


India has lost access to 26 out of 65 Patrolling Points in eastern Ladakh, says research paper
https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-has-lost-access-to-26-out-of-65-patrolling-points-in-eastern-ladakh-says-research-paper/article66428193.ece


Bite by kilometer-sized bite, China is eating away at India’s Himalayan borderlands. For decades, Asia’s two giants have fought a bulletless war for territory along their high-altitude border.

Recently, though, China has become more assertive, underscoring the need for a new Indian containment strategy.

On average, China launches one stealth incursion into India every 24 hours. Mr Kiren Rijiju, India’s Minister of State for Home Affairs, says the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is actively intruding into vacant border space with the objective of occupying it.

And according to a former top official with India’s Intelligence Bureau, India has lost nearly 2,000 sq km to PLA encroachments over the past decade.

The strategy underlying China’s actions is more remarkable than their scope. On land, like at sea, China uses civilian resources — herders, farmers and graziers — as the tip of the spear.

Once civilians settle on contested land, army troops gain control of the disputed area, paving the way for the establishment of more permanent encampments or observation posts.

Reason 8. The modi sarkar has been systematically undermining, nay destroying, institutions of governance and democracy
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=3431

Amendments made in 2018 to Prevention of Corruption Act  are at variance with this emotional speech of Modi Ji.

Reason 9. In the past 10 years crony capitalism has reached its zenith

https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=3561


Reason 10. 

Taxation has become usurious and extortive

There is no item on which there is no GST.
The greatest taxation.
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=3785

Hindus are the tax bank and the vote bank.
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=3856


Reason 11. Huge unemployment and underemployment, sharp devaluation of rupee and fall in its purchasing power, and skyrocketing prices.

https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=3874


Price of gas cylinder, petrol and diesel. The crude oil prices have fallen, but the petrol and diesel prices have shot up.

https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=4083


Reason 12. The BJP has perfected the art and science of blatant misuse of Law Enforcement Agencies for promoting its political interests and destroying the opposition, and thereby seriously undermining the rule of law and democracy.

https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=4102

BJP Washing Machine. Since 2014, 25 Opposition leaders facing corruption probe switched to BJP, 23 get reprieve. Misusing Law enforcement agencies.

Legality and propriety of any action.
Something can be done completely legally but was that done properly.
Arvind Kejeriwal was arrested for a case of 2022, and not today. Why was he arrested just before the election, on the day of electoral bond judgment? Why not wait for 2 more months?
They want to cripple the opposition right before the election.
Blatant misuse of Enforcement Directorate
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU?t=4128



Reason 13. Kashmir has almost been handed over to the MIddle East Sheikhs.
https://youtu.be/BRQFB2vKgmU&t=4241s

Actually not just Kashmire, but the entire Himalian belt. You can see by the rapidly increasing mosques.

30% Hindus in 1947, now almost zero.


Investment money coming from Arab countries.

Reason 14. Not an exaggeration to say that Bill Gates is the Super Prime Minister of India, and the Deep State has been ruling the roost compromising India's sovereignty.

So what do you think? Let me know.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK,

What you said about him may be right, I don't know him personally. 
But your comment is like shooting the messenger.
I mean, just because his personality is bad, should not mean what he says is wrong.

If we just focus on what he said, instead of his personality, I still feel that he is correct at most of what he said, if not all.

So a few specifically,

Naukri Jihad and Job Crusade. How many of you even know what Naukri Jihad is? The phrase 'Naukri Jihad' is first time for me, but I immediately knew what he ment, because I have been hearing those kind of things for quite some time now.

Hindus are under the greatest threat in this government. This is 100% true. It's going to get worse, let there be no doubt. 

Modi Sarkar has destroyed the Indian Military through agniveer. It's not just weakening it, but its also steadily getting Islamized. Extremely almaring.

ModiSarkar has let the Chinese occupy huge tracts of Indian territory. This is becoming more and more evident. What do you think Sonam Wangchuk is saying?

Hindus are the tax bank and the vote bank. You are aware of the number of schemes for them right?

Nageshwar Rao said, he has evidence, and that he can defend in court. And most of that evidence is available in the public domain. Which means, I also have them.

Maybe what I will do is, as I get time, will try to post with some evidence on those points.


BJP distanced itself from Kashmire Kasmiri Pandit issue. not genocide, but its palayan, exodus. Its not a holocaust, its simply migration.
