## Former CBI Director Nageswara Rao Interview with Vishal


The modi sarkar has been systematically undermining, nay destroying, institutions of governance and democracy

Amendments made in 2018 to Prevention of Corruption Act  are at variance with this emotional speech of Modi Ji.
Ability of CBI & all State Anti-Corruption Bureau is destroyed as they canNOT start even a preliminary enquiry against even a peon without prior order of Govt etc.
