BJP Washing Machine. Since 2014, 25 Opposition leaders facing corruption probe switched to BJP, 23 get reprieve. Misusing Law enforcement agencies.


Legality and propriety of any action.
Something can be done completely legally but was that done properly.
Arvind Kejeriwal was arrested for a case of 2022, and not today. Why was he arrested just before the election, on the day of electoral bond judgment? Why not wait for 2 more months?
They want to cripple the opposition right before the election.
Blatant misuse of Enforcement Directorate
