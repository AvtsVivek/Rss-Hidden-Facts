## Former CBI Director Nageswara Rao speech on RSS-BJP at Hyderabad

1. Why I say RSS Mukt bharat is the need of the hour. The following are some points from a speech of Former CBI Director Nageswara Rao. Not a single word is mine. Every word is his.

2. I am associated with RSS for 40 years(1981 to 2021). There after, I cut off from it. 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUato72vD5E&t=310s

3. They never make Hindus Buddhiman. They only make Hindus Moorkh. 

4. They make Hindus chant Bharat Mata ki Jai. But never beyond that.

5. I have come from inside RSS. I know how it works. They never want to empower Hindus. Why are they not freeing the temples? In the last nine years (since 2014), they have got the full majority, the Constitution is ammended(Sanshodhan) 7 times in the last nine years since 2014. https://youtu.be/DUato72vD5E?t=405

6. They only fool hindus saying we dont have majority in Rajya Sabha. If that is the case, how have they ammended(Sanshodhan) the Constitution 7 times? They are just fooling Hindus. They never want to empower Hindus. A week(durbal) samaj will listen to them. An empowered samaj will not listen to them. https://youtu.be/DUato72vD5E?t=445

7. They are not friends of Hinduism, they are enemies of Hinduism. They are totally Hindu Drohis. Theirs is chadma Hindutva or Sudo Hindutva. https://youtu.be/DUato72vD5E?t=513

8. Kuhna Hindutva, Wolf in Sheeps cloths. They have completely drugged and mesmorized hindus socity to serve their political intrests. This is the most dangerous thing. https://youtu.be/DUato72vD5E?t=546

9.  The Great Man Sita Ram GoelJi said - The Sangh Parivar is taking Hinduism and Hindus into the path of Distruction. If Sangh Parivar does not perish, Hindus or Hindu society will perish. Each and every word of is comming true now. https://youtu.be/DUato72vD5E?t=580
