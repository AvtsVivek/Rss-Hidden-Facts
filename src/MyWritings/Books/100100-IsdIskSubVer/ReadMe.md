Iskcon From Simping to Salvation


The fatal weakness which will pull down Iskcon collectively and the individual followers is the fact that everyone inherently feels he is above the rest of the world. 
From ant to elephant, the moment anyone who enters Iskcon, immediately he becomes a Maha Bhagavat, with intelligence as high as Bruhaspati himself. 
Because of this, the followers of Iskcon sees everyone else as inferior, and therefore they do not learn from outsiders.
