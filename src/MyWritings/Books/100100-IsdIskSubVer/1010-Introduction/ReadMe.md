Autul Sbhashcase. Dreconinan laws aganest men. If our leaders had the right intentioin, they would have amended the laws. This govt has absolutely no intention of working for Hindus.
Why do I say so
They would have done it in the last 10 years.
They clearly know that the hype will die down. Just wait for it, and it will die down.
Muslims have their own personal law board.
This establishment and their idological parent have no intention in the first place. Why have strengthed SCST act. And RSS did not oppose it.



This is an era of instutionial capture.

1. Because our leaders think that politicians are straight fwd. Politicians are not.  
2. Our leaders do now know how to face and nogitiate with duplicitous leaders. They are trained for that.


The curious care of Kerala
For decades, left ruled Kerala. Infact a communist political party won in Kerala, which is first in the world. 

But they could not erode the culture of kerala.

Joke Cartoon

A group of deep state guys are in a secret meeting, discussing Kerala. 
One of them says the communist party failed in their mission.
Another says now its time to install BJP. And another thinks in his mind, add ISKCON to mix, and it would do wonders.
 

Iskcon has become a bunch of betas who relish blue(or red pills, not sure) pills.


You can get quite far in a democracy if you can convince a majority that they are victims of a minority, and that only you can protect them.
