Yes, I heard this before. Usually for Yagnas both Wife AND Husband TOGETHER should sit.
Well such technical things should be clarified by experts like HG Gaur Hari Prabhu(Prof Ganesh).

And OoWeell weell well......

I would say, how can we puny pple simply appreciate who ModiJi is. Even for pple like Subramanian Swami.
Dont you know, Modi Ji is the Bhagavan VishnuJi's avatar? See Ref 1 in the end.

Narendra Modi is Surendra Modi. See Ref 2.

He is above everything. And everything is in Him. 

He is beyond everything.

So why the big fuss about this simple thing called Pran Prathishta Puja?

So I say we should all start chanting his glories. 

Jai Narendra Hare...
Swami Jai Surendra Hare...

Actually I should admit....

A few days back, Lord Vishnu in Modijis Avatar appeared to me in my dream.
With tears in my eyes, hair standing on end, and my body in Gad Gad, I was overwhelmed. 
I offered my obeisances and then He blessed me profusely. Then He ordered me to compile Modi Maha Puran.
I humbly enquired how can a dwarf like me, who cannot even speak properly can execute such a humongous task?
Then He gently smiled and said everything will be revealed in due course of time. 
All the abilities need will be bestowed when time comes.
He also mentioned that His glories will be chanted Aa Chandra Taararkam, as long as moon exists through my works.
Then He raised His Abhay Hasta and then disappeared.

Aaah, I simply cannot describe my experience with words.

So please look out for them, many publications are about to be eliminated from me.

2. वो नरों के ही नेता नहीं अब सुरों के भी नेता हैं ये बात आपकी जुबान से निकलती है। भगवान भी शुभ सोच रहा है।

Hope this does not offend anyone. Sometimes my head expands due to overheating, and this is the result.
