What I just wrote is mostly in satirical mood.

But mind you, there is much more serious and may likely even be a sinister dimensions to this that we all should keep an eye on.

First of all there is this the lord of the devtaas Indresh Kumar who declared Lord Ram to be imam-e-hind. See Ref 1 in the end.

And ofcourse here is His Highness Mohan BhagavatJi, whome I mediate 24X7 and not even a second passes by without his holy thoughts, backing it up. See Ref 2.

So what is imam-e-hind? IMAM literally means the person who leads prayers in a mosque.

This appears to be a deliberate attempt to reduce the stature of Lord Ram. This is the first point.

Then there is the second point, which is to build up a new cult figure. 

And who comes to the mind? Yup, You are right. Surendra ModiJi who is Bhagavan VishnuJi Avtar. See Ref 3 and 4 

So whats cooking here? We simply CANNOT take this lightly. 

Never ever think those are just any other election statement. This could be a well thought-out plan. 

You see, one way to control pple is use cult figures. In China there is Mao Zedong. 

Then there is Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong II in Korea. Ref 5

Religion is the opium of the masses, you heard it right?

So these RSS pple are upto something. Things are never what meets the eye.

Looks like they are they wanted a cult figure and finally they found it.

Yes, its Surendra Modi.

Some time back, I saw an image Modi holding hand of Lord Ram as a small child. I am not sure what is the source of this one.

Its too early to say, we need to wait and watch.

This RSS appears to be an Islamic Communist cocktail and are trying to build a cult figure and thats one and only Modi.

We need to carefully watchout for this.
