In 2014, there was Congress anti incumbency and Modi wave.

In 2019, there was Balakot resulting in Nationalist(Rastravad) wave.

Now, there is none. On the top of that, true colors of BJP/RSS are getting revieled. And pple are also realizing.
Furthermore, there is inflation, unemployment, external as well as internal security issues.
For example, after Nehru, China cpatured the maximum amount of land during Modi.
Pple also now know that Modi is the biggest lier, no other PM has ever lied as he does.
In fact, Modi is a liability for BJP. Nobody likes him, RSS does not want him.

Now tell me how do you expect such high numbers. If its not for Election Commission, there is no way.
If its free and far, there is no way NDA can cross 250.


How did you give 355? What is the basis?




Assuming that is true, 355 is way to much.


Are you aware of ChandiGhar Mayor Election where Preceeding officer is caught Red Handed in the CCTV. 
The preceeding officcer admitted right infront of CJI.
The BJP candidate was removed and AAP candidate became the mayor.

My basis for pointing ECI is, more than one crore votes were added, the numbers are increasing after the even after several days. That never happened before.
They have refused to submit form 17 A, before the court.
So this case will continue in the court, as far as I know, its not yet dismissed.

You must give credits where ever its due. There is ECI which works for him, and ofcourse there is media, so please mention them.




Bro what are you saying.. 
The entire elctoral bond saga was right below his nose. On the top of that, he tried to cover it up. 
Now he Election Commession adds up 1 Cr+ votes from its pockets for him.

And he will do what...?
 
 
Yoooo...
Excellent.
Also let us know whos gonna do it.
By the way  
मोदीजी की विदाई के तैयारियां आरम्भ हो चुकी हैं 


Anything less than 250 Modi is out. Again, remember there is ECI so anything can happen.

Whats wrong with that argument. 

EC is manupulating the data in the follwing way.
Three factors.
1. The inrodinate delay in putting the final figures of voter turnout.
2. Not putting out the absolute numbers phase after phase despite the citizens consitently telling the EC to put out absolute numbers instead of percentages
3. The unusually high increase in the voter turnout numbers

There are already cases in Supreme Court on this matter, and remember the case is not dismissed, its only will be taken up later not immediately.

This time there is not way as we saw in 2014 and 19. So how do you expect anything beyond 250 even at the best case.

And in the case of less than 250, most in BJP/RSS itself are eager to pull him down.

My question to you is, do you agree that Elctoral bonds is a major scam? Remember that its proven in court.
And yet, even after the judgement, BJP and modi shamelessly propagated that EBs are for transperency. 
The court clearly stated otherwise in its the judgement.

As far as the ECI is concerned, as I already said, its in court and it has not been dismissed. 
And I am sure, there will more cases filed on this after the election results. 

The court may not have used the word scam, but it is indeed the biggest institutionalized scam so far.
More over, the govt tried to hide the data, even as court ordered to make the data public.
Multiple pititions had to be filed later to force the govt to reveal the data.
 
If you dont want to call it a scam, then its an institutionalized corruption.
Its just semantics. 
If there is nothing wrong with it, why did the court ordered SBI to stop issuing the bonds with immediate effect.
All arguments are there in the judgement itself.

If you are in denail, if you dont want to accept, thats up to you, who can help
Its as clear as bright Sun shining in the sky.
There is courts judgement and this is the situation.
Just imageine, if there was no court judgement, what would have been the state.



Haribol!! Who is this Prabhiji? Voting for a Jihadi Modi is voting for Dharma? I think he must have lost his brain some where. Please ask him to check it.


No Prabhuji, when I was kid, I heard a story, where a monkey hung its heart on a tree branch, to just feel light. So its possible that he might have lost his brain.
His experience with Politics is very clear by his statements.
And by the way, you spoke my mind.
I say you all are deeply brainwashed with negative propaganda so whatever I tell you, with all the solid evidences and references and sometimes even court judgements, it won't sink for you. 
You might regret and lament after few years but at that point you won't be able to reverse your mistakes that you are doing now.

On the same point, listen to what Yuri Bezmenov is saying. You know who he is?

I just wondering the absurdity you exhibit again and again. 
First I posted about Mohan B, you said it was "Sheer anger, enviousness, derogatory and degraded language". 
The problem is you simply dont understand things. Did you try to understand what was their motive in first place and what the consequences of such statements are?

Then I posted about electoral bonds. Again you got it wrong without even reading it.
Electoral bonds issue is the most clear case, because there is Court judgement.

Then I posted about Vishnu Devs case. This starts to reveal his jihadi nature. 
Again your reaction is a knee jerk one. Looks like you did not even care to read one.

If this government falls and then another government comes, it will also be a corrupt government.
But if that government publishes a white paper on the corruption of this government, then this government will be exposed as the most corrupt government in the history of India.

This govt has legalized corruption through electoral bonds and through PM Care Funds.
