Nehru's miracles 
1. Rejected a permanent seat at the UN
2. Rejected Nepal’s offer to join Bharat
3. Rejected Balochistan’s offer to join Bharat
4. Created the Kashmir issue
5. Presided over the disastrous Sino-Bharat war
6. Refusal To Enter Nuclear Deal
7. Nehru rejected a US offer of helping Bharat with the development of a nuclear device in 1964 perhaps because he was a proponent of
non-violence. 
8. Led the ill-conceived Non-Aligned Movement 
9. Indifference towards Goa 
10. Favoured Socialism instead of free-market Capitalism. 
11. Ignored Corruption 
12. Clung to Power for too long 
13. Curbed journalistic freedom and freedom of expression 
14. Failure to encourage, promote and implement universal primary education 
15. Toppled democratically elected Kerala government in 1957
16. Gifted Pakistan
17. Didn't allow Sardar Patel to be the PM 
18. Gifting Manipur's Kabo valley to Burma
19. Gifting the strategically located Coco Islands to Burma
20. Refusing the Sultan of Oman's gift of Gwadar port 
21. Giving up on Tibet, placing Bharat's water security and northern border at China's mercy 
22. Signing the most unequal treaty in history
in 1960, PM Nehru, for the sake of "friendship" and "goodwill" signed one of the most unequal, lopsided treaties ever — the Indus Waters Treaty, giving Pakistan ownership of over three-fourths of the water that flows through the Indus System of Rivers located in Bharat. Pakistan reciprocated Nehru's gesture of goodwill by invading Bharat just five years later. 
23. Hostility towards Sardar Patel's restoration of the Somnath Temple 
24. Obstructing Sardar Patel's plan to liberate Hyderabad from the murderous Nizam
25. Nehru had a total impractical approach to integrating Kashmir with rest of Bharat. He didn't allow Sardar Patel to deal with Kashmir issue. Patel was quite successful in integrating other troubled regions such as Hyderabad Nizam's province with Bharat. 
26. During the Bharat-Pak war of 1948 when Bharat was gaining back the Kashmir captured by the invaders, he prematurely went to the UN Security Council. This was a great strategic mistake. Bharat now wants to distance itself from 3rd party intervention in the dispute and the UN resolutions on this, but it is Nehru who did it in the first place. 
27. Moreover, We were winning the war against CHlN but Nehru didn't allow Bhartiya Air Force to participate and we lost Aksai Chin area
