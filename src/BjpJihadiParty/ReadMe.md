BJP is a Jihadi Party.

Over the past several months, I have a growing feeling that BJP is a Jihadi Party.

BJP Mandiron ko Todta Jai while Pasmandas. 




---------------------------------


I call Modi a Jihadi for two reasons. There could be more, but for now just 2. The first one today, the second one may be tomorrow. 

The FIRST Reason. 

As early as Aug of 2016, Modi started revealing his heart. But did anyone realize whats about to come? 

He said Gau Rakshak business makes me angry. He was even suggesting state govts to prepare dossiers for such people.  

A year after again he says.. 

No person in this nation has the right to take the law in his or her own hands in this country: PM. References 4 and 6 
We are the land of non violence. We are the land of Mahatma Gandhi. Ref. 5

And in this video here, is crying for HIS people... 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58Ei7fJVOFk  

We now know the RULLS violence data. We have seen Bengal, Haryana and Manipur.
  
Today its a fact that Brahmins, Sadhus and Pujaris are being killed left right and center especially in westerner UP. 

What is his reaction? Total silence as if nothing is happening at all. 

But when it comes to Hindus, he invokes Gandhi, we are supposed to Non Violent.  

A simple challenge for you. Show me once sentence, statement or a piece of advice Modi has given to HIS pple in his decades long career.

Let me expand the scope for you. Try the with Mohan Bhagawat as well. One statement condeming the atrocities on Hindus.

One single statement addressing his jihadi men to exercise restraint, just one.

Take time to search on the net. You will reach the other end of the internet. But I can guarantee you will not find. Why?

How can you expect a jihadi leader to restrain his pple doing jihad? Think about it. Do take a look at the references below.

Remember Gandhi? He roamed around holding Gita in his hand. Whats the end result?

I will give the second Reason in a day or two. This will definitely be more thought provoking.
