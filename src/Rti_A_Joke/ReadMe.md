3. Everyone is aware of RTI right? The Right to Information act, the UPA govt brought it out way back in 2005. For many months now, I have been hearing that this RTI has become a joke, becuase pple file an RTI, then its pending for a long time, then the govt would say, the requested info doest not come under RTI and so the govt cannot provide the info. There was also a talk that RTI is slowly dying.
