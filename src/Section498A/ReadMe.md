This suicide case of #AtulSubhash 
Is deeply disturbing!.

A young son of 34 years lost his life so cheaply because of the Indian State Tyranny !!

With help if Indian govt a d judiciary,this Section 498A has become so draconian over the years  that the accused men are left with no option but to end their life! 

Look at Atul's horrifying story

His wife Nikita Singhania got him fixed in false charges for murder,dowry, unnatural sex, and what not
Was demanding 3 crore even when Atul was giving  her 40,000/month.
Herself working with Accenture, Nikita was demanding 2 lakh /month for child support

Worse was that Nikita literally instigated and mocked atul to commit suicide in front of the judge laughed at him, reportedly!

This is ,pure cold blooded murder of Atul...and the Indian govt, judiciary, Nikita, judge all should be charged with abetment of suicide and murder.
