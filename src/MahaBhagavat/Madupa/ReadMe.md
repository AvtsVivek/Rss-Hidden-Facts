Received from one of my contacts:
For those crying and screaming “Why wasn’t the WAQF Act scrapped?”
Read this. And read it well.

This isn’t just about scrapping a law.
This is about dismantling an empire.
And Modi is doing it brick by brick.
1. The Act wasn’t scrapped—
It was defeated.

Modi didn’t pull the trigger.
He pulled the teeth.
He didn’t need noise—he needed results.
He changed the rules, neutralised the poison, and tore down its power structure.

2. The Clerical Monopoly?
Smashed.

No more “topi-wearing-only” decisions.
Modi made it mandatory to include non-Muslims and women on WAQF boards.
The old guard can no longer control the narrative. They’ve been silenced by structure.

3. Opposition’s Ambush? Pre-empted.

Modi knew the outrage would come.
So he sent the bill to a Joint Parliamentary Committee—
Not to stall it.
But to expose it.
And invite legal scrutiny on record.
The snakes had no place left to hide.

4. Rajya Sabha Math?
Modi already planned the numbers game.

When the bill was introduced in Lok Sabha, BJP didn’t have the Rajya Sabha majority.

So he waited.
3 weeks later, BJP had the upper hand in RS.
Now the bill has swept through with no resistance.

Two birds, one stone.
Chess, not checkers.

5. Owaisi’s Panic?
Scripted.

Watch him shout.
Fume.
Shriek.

He knows the WAQF board’s unchecked rule is over.
The backdoor property loot is finished.
There’s no undo button now.

6. The BIG reason it wasn’t scrapped:
Had the law been struck down in one go…
WAQF Board would’ve walked away with all properties it captured till now.

Every temple land. Every public land.
Legally out of govt control. Forever.

Modi didn’t fall for that trap.

7. Now what?

The govt will create a national list.
All WAQF-ed properties will be registered.
Administration will come under govt.
Revenue will be claimed.
And properties will be returned to original rightful owners where possible.

This isn’t just lawmaking.
This is nation-healing.

Modi didn’t tear the tree down.
He dug out the roots.

To understand Modi’s politics, you need to rise above emotions.
Understand the war, not just the battlefield.
To those howling on TV screens and social media:
You were never the audience.

This wasn’t for show.
This was for Bharat.

Modi hai to mumkin hai.
Bharat Mata ki Jai.
