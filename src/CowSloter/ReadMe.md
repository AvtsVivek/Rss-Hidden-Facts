A few weeks ago, I posted about Modi strongly attacking Gau Rakshks. And I gave some references. 

Two such statements for you to recall. 

Modis Cow Gimiks

Around 2016, He said Gau Rakshak business makes me angry. He was even suggesting state govts to prepare dossiers for such people. Ref 2 

And then he says

No person in this nation has the right to take the law in his or her own hands in this country: PM. References 4 and 6 

Now did anyone realize what the consequences of these statements.

There are two important consequences that I came across, I will share the first one today. The second may be some other time.

When PM Modi gave those statements, no one realized whats the motive. And the result was, India is 2nd largest beef exporter, some even say we are at top. So here are the sequence of events.

1. Way back in 2013-14 Modi was declared PM candidate. For most, it was love at first sight. Who did not fell for Him? And as he was roaming around campaigning, he talked about Pink Revolution, highlighting it and strongly condemning it on multiple occasions. Ref 12

2. But even before the elections, the BJP was securing donations from beef companies behind the curtains. Ref 13. What do such donations mean? They are deals. I talked about quid pro quo in my last post. So essentially we are paying you, you will not make any policies againest us or will only make policies in our intrest. 

3. In 2014 Modi won, everyone is in high spirits and exited.

4. Then in 2015, this news broke out about beef company donations, but no one noticed, everyone is fully drunk on Modi.  Ref 14. 

5. Come 2016, 17, he made the following statements, and asked state governments to prepare "dossiers" on the so-called cow protectors. Ref 1. 

Then, No person in this nation has the right to take the law in his or her own hands in this country: PM. References 4 and 6 
We are the land of non violence. We are the land of Mahatma Gandhi. Ref. 5
And in this video here, is crying for HIS people. Ref 15

6. Thats it. Any Hindu who had a bit of spine and had some conscience to protect cows became a criminal. And the cow butchers got the free hand. Take a look at Ref 16, 17 and 18. 

7. So this Jhumlendra Bhai Modi talked about Pink revolution in 2013. But his govt gave them 33% more money. Ref 19

8. And the rest as they say is history. India emerges to the top. Ref 20. 

9.  And now Mithun meet is official. Ref 21 and 22

10.   And I even heard that in Rajasthan beef is getting home delivered. 

11.   I talked about Electoral bonds in my last post. So beef exporting companies giving donations via EBs. 

12.  OK, So are you disturbed, depressed? Worry not. Modiji for rescue. Who else?

13. Aahhh... Thanks Modiji. Now am sooooo Proud.
