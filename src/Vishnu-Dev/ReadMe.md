Aahh... Finally there is some relief. 

Here is how I would like to start.

The Great 108 Modi in a Rally in 2019 Uvaaachaaa...

People go to Saudi Arabia for Haj, but some of them who do something wrong are jailed there. 
Recently, I requested the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to return these 850 people back before the holy month of Ramzan. 
He accepted my request and agreed to send them back to India. (See Ref 2 in the end).

In hindi.

सभी लोग हज के लिए सऊदी अरब गए थे, लेकिन उनमें से कुछ को गलतियों के कारण जेल में बंद कर दिया गया। 
मैंने सऊदी के क्राउन प्रिंस से आग्रह किया था कि वे इन सभी 850 लोगों को पवित्र महीना रमजान से पहले मुक्त कर दें। 
उन्होंने हमारा आग्रह स्वीकार कर लिया था। See Ref 1.

Note the words Ramzan and Haj. So who are these 850 "PEOPLE" for which this man is so desperate?

Thats Modi(56 inch, Aaakh se Aaakh milaa kar bat karne wala) for you. BEGGING them. For what? 

Please Wait...There is more...

There is one name which is NOT PRESENT in that list. His name is Vishnu Dev. He is in jail from 2018. 

You will be surprised about the reason for jail. 

Vishnu is on a conversation on Twitter with a Muslim girl. 

She made objectionable remarks against Lord Shiva. 

An enraged Vishnu Dev then tweeted against Prophet Muhammad. 

He also asked as to why schools in Yemen were bombed if Allah was merciful. 

Thats it. Do I have to say more?

Here is the full article in Ref 3.

Vishnu has not denied the charges against him, but he has apologized for the "wrongs" he did. According to his father, he "said that he apologizes to all Muslims in the world for his mistake." See Ref 4.

Finally after spending 5.5 years in jail, he is released. Thats the good news.

What did the Modi Sarkar do? Stupid question. Dont you remember Nupur Sharma? Thats with puny Qatar. And Telangana MLA Raja Singh?

I feel, Vishnu should have converted to Islam, instead of apologizing, then and there, he would have been free in 2019 itself. 

So yaah...What I am trying to say is the following.

DONT BE STUPID. BE VERY VERY CAREFUL, especially with Modi and HIS PEOPLE. 

DONT DARE to commit any offence AGAINEST HIM and HIS MEN even in a dream.

We need to continue to vote, chant sing and dance the glories of Modi and do Aarti to him.

Continue to hear his pravachans and his glories and meditate on them. 

Instead of talking against him, We have to say, because of Modi, Vishnu was released well before 10 years, or no beheading happened.

Param Dayalu hai ModiJi(eyes are in tears, aashrudhara ...). Such a leader appears once in a millinium. THANKS MODIJI..

Har Har Modi Ghar Ghar Modi.
