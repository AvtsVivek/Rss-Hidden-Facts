True colors of Modi. 

Modi himself explianing if muslims 

मोदी का सही स्वरूप अगर मुसलमान जान जाएँगे तो मुसलमान मोदी से प्रेम करने लग जाएगा और ये बेचारे बहुत “भोले-भाले” हैं। भगवान अगर मुझे अवसर दे तो मैं सबसे ज़्यादा इनका भला करूँगा

If Muslims know the true nature of Modi then Muslims will start loving Modi and these poor people are very “innocent”. If God gives me a chance, I will do the most good to them.

अब भी समय है हिंदुओं मोदी का सही स्वरूप जानलो मोदी केवल और केवल मुसलमानों के लिए ही काम कर रहे हैं॥

BJP Love Jihad

फर्क सिर्फ नीति, नीयत और नेतृत्व का है। पहली की सरकारों ने जहां अल्पसंख्यक वर्ग के विकास पर नहीं दिया कोई ध्यान, वहीं मोदी सरकार ने सुनिश्चित किया सबका साथ - सबका विकास।

Officers In Charge of CAG Reports on Ayushman Bharat Graft, Bharatmala Cost Irregularities Transferred

The two reports put the BJP-led Union government on the backfoot after the opposition accused it of presiding over “scams” in flagship schemes. The parties demanded accountability from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After The Wire published its reports, the CAG, in a press release, called them 'erroneous and baseless'.
