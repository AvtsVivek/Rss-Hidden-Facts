True colors of Modi. 

Modi himself explianing if muslims 

मोदी का सही स्वरूप अगर मुसलमान जान जाएँगे तो मुसलमान मोदी से प्रेम करने लग जाएगा और ये बेचारे बहुत “भोले-भाले” हैं। भगवान अगर मुझे अवसर दे तो मैं सबसे ज़्यादा इनका भला करूँगा

If Muslims know the true nature of Modi then Muslims will start loving Modi and these poor people are very “innocent”. If God gives me a chance, I will do the most good to them.

अब भी समय है हिंदुओं मोदी का सही स्वरूप जानलो मोदी केवल और केवल मुसलमानों के लिए ही काम कर रहे हैं॥

BJP Love Jihad

फर्क सिर्फ नीति, नीयत और नेतृत्व का है। पहली की सरकारों ने जहां अल्पसंख्यक वर्ग के विकास पर नहीं दिया कोई ध्यान, वहीं मोदी सरकार ने सुनिश्चित किया सबका साथ - सबका विकास।

Officers In Charge of CAG Reports on Ayushman Bharat Graft, Bharatmala Cost Irregularities Transferred

The two reports put the BJP-led Union government on the backfoot after the opposition accused it of presiding over "scams" in flagship schemes. The parties demanded accountability from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After The Wire published its reports, the CAG, in a press release, called them 'erroneous and baseless'.

My Response.

I will tell why I felt he resembles Gandhi, just need a couple of days. Its simple, not complicated. Need to pull out the facts.

Meanwhile,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everyone is aware of RTI right? The Right to Information act, the UPA govt brought out way back in 2005.

For many months now, I have been hearing that this RTI has become a joke, becuase pple file an RTI, then its pending for a long time, then the govt would say, the requested info doest not come under RTI and so the govt cannot provide the info. There was also a talk that RTI is slowly dying. See Ref 3.

I was sceptical of such claims. An individual files a request, and the authority will provide if it is within his perview.

Then I came to know about this news where a Railway officer is transfered abruptly. He gave info regading the cost of PM Modi selfie booths. See Ref 1.

I was not surprized by such transfers, because a few months ago CAG offices were transfered by the govt for exposing corruption. See Ref 2.

So the message here is silent and clear. If something govt does not want you to know, you just cannot know. And the govt officers better be careful before giving out any info to the public with the govt does not like.

Hmm...Felt like we are slowly and studily moving towards China. In China the govt spends billons to ensure the only footage westren media have is what the ccp wants them to see.
