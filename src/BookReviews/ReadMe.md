Now that we are on the topic.

I am still at the beginning, and thought I will do a review after finising the below book. 

Sangh Parivar ki Rajneeti: Ek Hindu Aalochana

Its only in Hindi and I am very slow in Hindi.

https://www.amazon.in/-/hi/Shankar-Sharan/dp/B0B9Y8Q9FW

Its a collection of essays, mostly by the author Shankar Sharan and a few others.

We can dismiss saying that its the openion of the authors, but I think we should not, before giving this book sometime.

Based on my research so far the following is what I found about RSS.

1. First and foremost, they dont follow any books. Any ideology today has books as basis. 
While Sanatan Dharm has the largest reservoir of Books, these Sangh Parivar bunch has completely rejected all, and cliam to be protectors of Sanatan Dharm. Makes no sense at all.

2. The RSS has a very large cader, and is completly kept in dark, much like Islam. 
But the difference between Islam and Sangh Parivar is Islam has books. But the mass followers of islam are not supposed to read and understand them.
When anyone with a normal sense of reasoning reads them, will immediately be Ex-Mus. So its necessary that the cadre needs to be kept in dark.

These RSS bunch have comeup with a demi god called BharatMata, and the cadre is supposed to do  BharatMata ki jai.

3. This is important. The top brass are basically impersonalists at core. And so they have a very strong affinity towards islam. 

Its not an exaturation to say, they are a bunch of islamists, but appear to be Hindus externally.

If you watch carefully, this is reviled all the time by their statements.  

So now, are you surprised by the following?

	why look for Shivling in every mosque? - Mohan Bhagavat
	
	50 वर्षों के लिए देवी देवताओं को भूल जाएं युवा - Mohan Bhagavat

Needless to say, not a single word again Muslims even as they are butchring their own cadre.


So my feeling is BJP must completely get rid of RSS idology. If not the decline is certain. Looks like its already began.
