Now that we are on the topic.

I am still at the beginning, and thought I will do a review after finishing the below book.

Sangh Parivar ki Rajneeti: Ek Hindu Aalochana

It's only in Hindi and I am very slow in Hindi.

https://www.amazon.in/-/hi/Shankar-Sharan/dp/B0B9Y8Q9FW

It's a collection of essays, mostly by the author Shankar Sharan and a few others.

We can dismiss saying that it's the opinion of the authors, but I think we should not, before giving this book sometime.

Based on my research so far the following is what I found about RSS.

First and foremost, they don't follow any books. Any ideology today has books as the basis. While Sanatan Dharm has the largest reservoir of Books, these Sangh Parivar bunch has completely rejected all, and claim to be protectors of Sanatan Dharm. Makes no sense at all. 

Second, the RSS has a very large cadre, and is completely kept in the dark, much like Islam. But the difference between Islam and Sangh Parivar is Islam has books. But the mass followers of islam are not supposed to read and understand them. When anyone with a normal sense of reasoning reads them, they will immediately be Ex-Mus. So it's necessary that the cadre needs to be kept in the dark.

These RSS bunch have come up with a demigod called BharatMata, and the cadre is supposed to do BharatMata ki jai.

Last but not the least, and this is important. The top brass are basically impersonalists at core. And so they have a very strong affinity towards islam.

It's not an exaggeration to say, they are a bunch of islamists, but appear to be Hindus externally.

If you watch carefully, this is revealed all the time by their statements.

So now, are you surprised by the following?

Why look for Shivling in every mosque? - Mohan Bhagavat

50 वर्षों के लिए देवी देवताओं को भूल जाएं युवा - Mohan Bhagavat
Needless to say, not a single word again Muslims even as they are butchering their own cadre.

So my feeling is BJP must completely get rid of RSS ideology. If not, the decline is certain. Looks like it's already begun.
