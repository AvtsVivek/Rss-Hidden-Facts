What an idddeeeiiaaaaahhh.........

Hmmm.... A new political party.

You know..., around two years ago, I mentioned about a new political party called Ekam Sanatan Bharat Dal.

https://www.ekam4sanatan.org/elibrary/

I was a founding member, attended meetings, and distributed phamplets on streets.

Do you know whats the current state? 

Its on life support, if not fully dead.

You know why? From the very beginning, its been sabotaged. 

By whom you ask? Yuuupppp.... the very establishment, that you love and adore. 

And I had been the witness at every step of it.

Am not sure I mentioned this before, but here its again.

This RSS is the cancer for this country, now in stage 3 if not 4.

THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THIS COUNTRY CAN EVER STAND UP AGAIN, AS LONG AS RSS IS AROUND. LET THERE BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

SSSSSoooo go ahead, float a party. I am with you.

After valuable time and resources lost, one thing will definitely happen.

You will then finally understand fully the true colors of RSS. 

You will understand how deep its roots are and to where they go and connect.

Mark my words, you will be AMAZED.

Some lessons are learnt only the hardway.

Abhi to app sab Bachhheeee haaeein.

This exercise will let you grow... finally... 

Only after this will you all be able to fully recover from the intoxication due to the blue pill overdose.

Caaannnntt wait.... Aaaaaam exicited.....

and plz dont think I am mocking.

SSSoooww....

WellllllllCome to the red pill club.

Hmmm....
Voting for Pappu... Thats not baaaad.

You know, 
In this very regime, 

After Aurangazeeb, if not more, maximum temples are destroyed, starting with Kashi, and now in Bengal.

Maximum number of Atrocities againest Hindus, displacing from their homes in, Bengal, Manipur, Bangladesh and again Bengal.

Maximum number of Hindus killed are in this Jihadi Modis Regime.

Roits, amximum number, in this Jihadi Regime. 

Earlier the stone pelting used to be in Kashmir, its now every where.

Adultry is now legalized by this Regime.

And this Aranab...If he had any integrity, he would have addressed these issue. 

A journalist would critique current establishment, not a previous one to divert attention.

This shows how the media is sold off in this current regime.



Thats just a feeeewww...red pills ...kinda tasting menu. As I said, got loads of them.

And Since the topic is still hot around WAQF, did you know how this Sangh/RSS/BJP supported it always?

Take a look at he following tweets.

Dear hindus,
Hold your seat belts..
Waqf 1995 act was not just supported by BJP but it's MP Ram Ratan had moved an amendment that the "law of limitations" shud not be applicable to #Waqf properties!
So BJP has been in cahoots with congress in passing this Waqf bill since 1995

Source of information...In his book while praising ABV and BJP, 
he writes about the proceedings of parliament in 1995 when Waqf act was passed and thanks BJP MP Ram Ratan for getting the "law of limitations' added to WAQF act...

Ok, so forget everything.

Lets say for a moment, that only and only congress is responsible for WAQF, and that our great Ram Bhakt has brought up a revolution with his new law.

So I just want to know, the same question again, 

IS THERE IN ANYWAY this new law brings benefits to Hindus at all. If so what is it? 

Or is it that we are just swindled again. 

What I feel is, there is absolutely NOTHING beneficial for HINDUS in any way, more and more drama just to swindle Hindus into thinking that there is.

Aree baba, forget those dramas, explain to me as a layman.

If a mulla usurps my property, I now have the legal right to circumambulate the courts for the next 20 years, and I should be jubilant about it, 
because I am the chosen one, by these mullas? A lamb should be grateful, because the wolf has choose it for dinner. Is that what you mean?
Or is there something else that my puny brain cannot comprehend?
