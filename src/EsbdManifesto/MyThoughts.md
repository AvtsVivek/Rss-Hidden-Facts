1. ExMuslim Issue.
   1. ExMuslims want official recongnition and protection from state. They want the politicians and lawers to come forward and help with this. Listen to what ExMuslim Sahil wants us(politicans) to do. He wants ExMuslim Issue to be a national issue. Take just one minute and please listen to the following.

   3. Lets say Bjp comes up with a middle position and promotes terms like **Athest** or **No Relegion** to apply to every relegion, we should not allow it. This means they are only trying to pull Hinduism down to the level of Abrahamic relegions. Hindusim does not force any one and already includes Charwak/Athgestic philosaphy.
   4. Thiking to fwd this message to SandeepJi. I feel he should call ExMuslim Sahil to ISD channel to undrestand his concersns.

2. Hindu superiority. 
   1. Rss/Bjps tendency is to pull down the superiority of Hindus as aginest Islam/Chistianity. They try to potray Hinduism at par with other relegions. 
   2. We on the other hand should not allow this. Our national president said that we will seek votes from Hindus only. Then in such a case, we should not allow Hinduism to be pulled down to the level of any Abrahemic relegion. We should be very clear why Hinduism is superior and we should strongly uphold this view. 
3. Wokism
   1. We need to have a strong stand againest Wokism. We cannot allow wokism to distroy our families, societies and countries.
   2. Please plan, and take time to watch the entire 45 minute video.
